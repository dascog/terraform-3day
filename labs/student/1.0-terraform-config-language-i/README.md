# Exercise 1.0 The Terraform Configuration Language I
This exercise combines a series of hashicorp terraform tutorials that cover some of the configuration language features we have learned so far.
## 1. Define Infrastructure with Terraform Resources (20-30min)

## 2. Manage Similar Resources with Count (20mins)
- https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/count?in=terraform/configuration-language

## 3. Advanced! Manage Similar Resources with For Each (45mins)
- this is quite an advanced tutorial - it doesn't describe very clearly *how* to separate the EC2 instances out into a separate module. It is worth trying it yourself from the tutorial description, and then cloning the solution repository to compare your files if you are not able to get it working successfully.
