# I have already installed terraform using chocolatey on the VMs, and configured the auto-complete option.
# I have a user group on AWS IAM that has the following permissions:
## AmazonVPCFullAccess
## AmazonEC2FullAccess
## AmazonS3FullAccess
# I created a secret key from that account and used it to configure the AWS CLI on a VM (note: this will be deleted before the machine image is frozen.)

# Using the CLIs
## You will need to help them decide which shell they are going to use. Most of what we will do will be through the command line. I have been using Git Bash and PowerShell with no problems. 
## NOTE: Docker on the Windows Server 2019 version we have on the VMs is problematic 
- the VMs do not have Hyper-V capability, so Docker Desktop will not function, which means the only way to run Docker is with native windows containers. 
- I have tried to get full functionality for Docker on Windows using the steps in https://blog.sixeyed.com/getting-started-with-docker-on-windows-server-2019/
- It does mean Linux native containers like nginx will not work. I have replaced these with windows containers in the examples. 




# TIDY UP
