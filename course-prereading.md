# Pre-reading and pre-study for Terraform 3-day Course
The course will cover Terraform with AWS basics from the beginning,and will include a comprehensive introduction to Git, however we do assume some background in the following areas:
1. Basic familiarity with navigating around a Linux (bash) command line. If you are unsure, [the ubuntu introduction](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview) is perfect.
2. Basic familiarity with VS Code. Try the official [VS Code introduction](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics)
3. Some knowledge of AWS is an advantage, but not assumed. [This is a good starting point](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/).

## Terraform Introduction (YouTube)
The following video gives an excellent short introduction to familiarize yourself with the concepts:
- [Terraform explained in 15mins](https://youtu.be/l5k1ai_GBDE)

## O'Reilly
There are a number of Terraform books on O'Reilly training if you would like to go deeper. These will be more useful after the course as references.
- [Terraform: Up & Running](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/terraform-up/9781492046899/) is a good place to start and is very well reviewed as an introduction.
- Terraform in Action: This has both a [book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/terraform-in-action/9781617296895/) and a [video](https://www.oreilly.com/videos/terraform-in-action/9781617296895VE/)
